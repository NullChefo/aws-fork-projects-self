* create a VPC with 1 public and 1 private subnet using a CIDR range of 10.0.1.0/24

* create another VPC with only 1 private subnet using a CIDR range of 10.0.2.0/24

* create a VPC peering connection and accept the connection.

* create first ec2 instance in first vpc in public subnet 

* create second ec2 instance in secondd vpc in private subnet.

* ssh into the public ec2 instance, copy the .pem file and try ssh into the private instance using ssh -i ec2key.pem ec2-user@<private instance ip address>

* now modify the route table to first vpc's public subnet and add route for the second vpc CIDR block with target as peering connection

* now modify the route table to first vpc's public subnet and add route for the second vpc CIDR block with target as peering connection
