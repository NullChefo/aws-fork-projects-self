If you are not able to ssh into the EC2 machine, then perform the following checks:

* check the security group of the EC2 instance and verify that port 22 is enabled.
* check if the EC2 instance has a public ip address assigned.
* check if the EC2 instance is in a subnet which is a public subnet. If you are not sure, then better is to delete the VPC and create a new default VPC (steps below).
* check if the VPC has an internet gateway attached to it. If not, then delete the VPC (which will delete all the resources) and create a new default VPC. 
* You can create a default VPC by going to the VPC service, then "Your VPCs" -> "Actions" dropdown, then select "Create Default VPC". This will create a default VPC will all the right configuration.
* Then create a new EC2 instance using the new VPC and hopefully you should be able to connect.
